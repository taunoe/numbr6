# Coat of arms of the accountant

I like history and I like medieval European coats of arms. Of course, nowadays, their design has its own rules and order. But when I have searched the early ones and found some. They can look wild. So I thought to make some mixed ones — medieval combined with electronics.

## Hardware and electronics

The base is a solid oak panel. Hand carved and coated with antique beeswax. I use tinned copper wire TCW18. The MCU board is an Arduino Pro micro (not original). And I use PIR HC-SR501 sensor.

For 7-segment LEDs, I designed a PCB board. Which can hold three of them. I ordered them from PCBWay.
